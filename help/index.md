Minesweeper
===========
![Logo](logo.gif)

Minesweeper is a game where you try to find the hidden "_mines_" or _bombs_ on a board without clicking on any of them.
 
The number of neighboring mines will give you clues as to which square may or may not have a _mine_.

If you can uncover all the squares that don't have a _mine_, you win!
