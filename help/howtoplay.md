How to Play
===========

Minesweeper is played with a mouse. You use the left mouse to click on a square you believe to be free of _mines_. 
You use the right mouse button to click on squares that you believe have a _mine_.

It is game over if you open a location on the grid with a bomg. However, if you open a location on the grid without a mine you will be given a hint with how many _mines_ are in the surrounding area. 
If the square is blank there are no _mines_ in the immediately adjacent squares. Otherwise you get a count between 1 and 8. 

In the example above row two, column eight has a 1. Because all of the surrounding squares revealed, we know that the square in the lower left (row three, column seven) is a _mine_. So we should right click on it to flag it as such.

When a square is flagged you can still accidentally click on it and explode, so be careful.

There are times where you will have to take a leap of faith and guess which square is a _mine_. 
This is _unfortunately_ normal in minesweeper.

If you manage to reveal all of the locations on the grid that do not have a _mine_, then you WIN!
