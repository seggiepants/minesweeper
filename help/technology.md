Technology
==========

This program was made in part as a test bed for trying out new/unfamiliar technologies. Some of the more interesting parts are as follows.


* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html): The current high score is saved in a JSON file. This format allows saving data in a key value manner with nested objects and arrays of objects.
* [Sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html): Difficulty levels and high scores are saved in a Sqlite3 database. This library lets you have a SQL database as a single file without driver or server concerns. In test mode, an in-memory database is used.
* [tkInter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): Is a GUI library that is normally shipped with Python.
* [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development): I didn't follow through but I wanted to try this out on a non-trivial project. Basically you make tests to confirm that things work or don't work as you build the program. I still need to work on this part more.
* [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/): Documentation generator. Haven't got this fully working yet.
